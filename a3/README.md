## Setup
* macOS 12.2.1
* IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.2 (Community Edition)
* kotlin.jvm 1.7.10
* Java SDK 17.0.4 (corretto)
 
## Enhancement 
### Timer for Each Player
* Add a timer for each player. The timer will start when it is its player's round and stop when it is the other player's round.
* This allow the players to know how much time they have been spend when it is their round
* This idea is inspired by the GO game. However, the time is unlimited in this game and the winner is not determined by the time. So the timer is only for reference
