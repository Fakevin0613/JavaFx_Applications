## Setup
* macOS 12.2.1
* IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.2 (Community Edition)
* kotlin.jvm 1.7.10
* Java SDK 17.0.4 (corretto)
 
## Enhancement 
### Allow to pick a colour scheme for the visualizations.
* In the tool bar, user can select the color scheme from the dropdown list and the bar graphs and pie graphs' color will change accordingly
* There are three types of color scheme available.
### Add more properties / tags to notes than “archived”.
* In both ListView and GridView, the notes are classified to be urgent/archived. 
* The urgent notes will be on top of all normal and archived notes so that user can pay more attention to them.
* User can choose the checkbox to classify them
* A note cannot be both urgent and archived at the same time because it is common sense that an urgent note would not be archived.
